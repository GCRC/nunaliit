[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GCRC/nunaliit.png)](https://travis-ci.org/GCRC/nunaliit)

Nunaliit Atlas Framework (Nunaliit) is a system for creating interactive, data-driven web atlases supporting user
editing of documents and geometries, integrated multimedia, document relations, flexible data schemas, self-replication,
dynamic push updates to the browser for new objects, and online/offline tablet-based editing and syncing.

It has been created by a team at the [Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre](http://gcrc.carleton.ca) (GCRC) at
Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Sample atlases developed over many years of Nunaliit development are available to
interact with on the GCRC [Atlases page](https://gcrc.carleton.ca/confluence/x/7wEV).

Pre-compiled and packaged Nunaliit .tar.gz and .zip files can be [downloaded from the Maven central repository]
(http://central.maven.org/maven2/ca/carleton/gcrc/nunaliit2-couch-sdk/); however, those builds can get a bit old so we recommend building the latest code from master when starting out so you will have the same version the team at GCRC is running.

The [Documentation](https://github.com/GCRC/nunaliit/wiki/)
describes the setup and use of Nunaliit, as well as build instructions for developers.
