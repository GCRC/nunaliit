Nunaliit Atlas Framework (Nunaliit) is a system for creating interactive, data-driven web atlases supporting user
editing of documents and geometries, integrated multimedia, document relations, flexible data schemas, self-replication,
dynamic push updates to the browser for new objects, and online/offline tablet-based editing and syncing.

It has been created by a team at the [Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre](http://gcrc.carleton.ca) (GCRC) at
Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Sample atlases developed over many years of Nunaliit development are available to
interact with on the GCRC [Atlases page](https://gcrc.carleton.ca/index.html?module=module.gcrcatlas_atlases).

Pre-compiled and packaged Nunaliit .tar.gz files can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/GCRC/nunaliit/releases) tab in GitHub.

The [Documentation](https://github.com/GCRC/nunaliit/wiki/)
describes the setup and use of Nunaliit, as well as build instructions for developers.
