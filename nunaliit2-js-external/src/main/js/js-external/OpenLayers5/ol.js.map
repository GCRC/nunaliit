The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`.

Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But a View object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n  * @api\n */\nvar View = /*@__PURE__*/(function (BaseObject) {\n  function View(opt_options) {\n    BaseObject.call(this);\n\n    var options = assign({}, opt_options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n     */\n    this.animations_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n    this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @const\n     * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n     */\n    this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n    this.applyOptions_(options);\n  }\n\n  if ( BaseObject ) View.__proto__ = BaseObject;\n  View.prototype = Object.create( BaseObject && BaseObject.prototype );\n  View.prototype.constructor = View;\n\n  /**\n   * Set up the view with the given options.\n   * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n   */\n  View.prototype.applyOptions_ = function applyOptions_ (options) {\n\n    /**\n     * @type {Object<string, *>}\n     */\n    var properties = {};\n    properties[ViewProperty.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n    var resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n     */\n    this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n    var centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n    var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n    var rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Constraints}\n     */\n    this.constraints_ = {\n      center: centerConstraint,\n      resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n      rotation: rotationConstraint\n    };\n\n    if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n      properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n    } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n      properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n\n      if (this.resolutions_) { // in case map zoom is out of min/max zoom range\n        properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = clamp(\n          Number(this.getResolution() || properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION]),\n          this.minResolution_, this.maxResolution_);\n      }\n    }\n    properties[ViewProperty.ROTATION] = options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n    this.setProperties(properties);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {ViewOptions}\n     */\n    this.options_ = options;\n\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

WebGL rendering, so that accessing\n * directly the WebGL API should not be required anymore.\n *\n * Several operations are handled by the `WebGLHelper` class:\n *\n * ### Define custom shaders and uniforms\n *\n *   *Shaders* are low-level programs executed on the GPU and written in GLSL. There are two types of shaders:\n *\n *   Vertex shaders are used to manipulate the position and attribute of *vertices* of rendered primitives (ie. corners of a square).\n *   Outputs are:\n *\n *   * `gl_Position`: position of the vertex in screen space\n *\n *   * Varyings usually prefixed with `v_` are passed on to the fragment shader\n *\n *   Fragment shaders are used to control the actual color of the pixels rawn on screen. Their only output is `gl_FragColor`.\n *\n *   Both shaders can take *uniforms* or *attributes* as input. Attributes are explained later. Uniforms are common, read-only values that\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\n *\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\n *   ```js\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\n *   this.program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\n *   this.context.useProgram(this.program);\n *   ```\n *\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\n *   ```js\n *   this.context.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Defining post processing passes\n *\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\n *\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\n *\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\n *\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\n *\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them:\n *\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using `WebGLArrayBuffer` objects.\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound everytime the data it holds is changed. Using `WebGLHelper.bindBuffer`\n *   will bind the buffer and flush the new data to the GPU.\n *\n *   For now, the `WebGLHelper` class expects {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\n *   ```js\n *   // at initialization phase\n *   this.verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *   this.indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *\n *   // at rendering phase\n *   this.context.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   this.context.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Specifying attributes\n *\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses. Use `WebGLHelper.enableAttributeArray` and either\n *   the default attribute names in {@link module:ol/webgl/Helper~DefaultAttrib} or custom ones.\n *\n *   Please note that you will have to specify the type and offset of the attributes in the data array. You can refer to the documentation of [WebGLRenderingContext.vertexAttribPointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer) for more explanation.\n *   ```js\n *   // here we indicate that the data array has the following structure:\n *   // [posX, posY, offsetX, offsetY, texCoordU, texCoordV, posX, posY, ...]\n *   let bytesPerFloat = Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;\n *   this.context.enableAttributeArray(DefaultAttrib.POSITION, 2, FLOAT, bytesPerFloat * 6, 0);\n *   this.context.enableAttributeArray(DefaultAttrib.OFFSETS, 2, FLOAT, bytesPerFloat * 6, bytesPerFloat * 2);\n *   this.context.enableAttributeArray(DefaultAttrib.TEX_COORD, 2, FLOAT, bytesPerFloat * 6, bytesPerFloat * 4);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Rendering primitives\n *\n *   Once all the steps above have been achieved, rendering primitives to the screen is done using `WebGLHelper.prepareDraw` `drawElements` and `finalizeDraw`.\n *   ```js\n *   // frame preparation step\n *   this.context.prepareDraw(frameState);\n *\n *   // call this for every data array that has to be rendered on screen\n *   this.context.drawElements(0, this.indicesBuffer.getArray().length);\n *\n *   // finalize the rendering by applying post processes\n *   this.context.finalizeDraw(frameState);\n *   ```\n *\n * For an example usage of this class, refer to {@link module:ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer~WebGLPointsLayerRenderer}.\n *\n *\n * @api\n */\nvar WebGLHelper = /*@__PURE__*/(function (Disposable) {\n  function WebGLHelper(opt_options) {\n    Disposable.call(this);\n    var options = opt_options || {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {HTMLCanvasElement}\n     */\n    this.canvas_ = document.createElement('canvas');\n    this.canvas_.style.position = 'absolute';\n\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {WebGLRenderingContext}\n     */\n    this.gl_ = getContext(this.canvas_);\n    var gl = this.getGL();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Object<string, BufferCacheEntry>}\n     */\n    this.bufferCache_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Array<WebGLShader>}\n     */\n    this.shaderCache_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {!Array<WebGLProgram>}\n     */\n    this.programCache_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {WebGLProgram}\n     */\n    this.currentProgram_ = null;\n\n    /**\n     * @type {boolean}\n     */\n    this.hasOESElementIndexUint = includes(WEBGL_EXTENSIONS, 'OES_element_index_uint');\n\n    // use the OES_element_index_uint extension if available\n    if (this.hasOESElementIndexUint) {\n      gl.getExtension('OES_element_index_uint');\n    }\n\n    listen(this.canvas_, ContextEventType.LOST,\n      this.handleWebGLContextLost, this);\n    listen(this.canvas_, ContextEventType.RESTORED,\n      this.handleWebGLContextRestored, this);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.projectionMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.offsetRotateMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n     */\n    this.offsetScaleMatrix_ = createTransform();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.tmpMat4_ = create();\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Object.<string, WebGLUniformLocation>}\n     */\n    this.uniformLocations_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Object.<string, number>}\n     */\n    this.attribLocations_ = {};\n\n    /**\n     * Holds info about custom uniforms used in the post processing pass.\n     * If the uniform is a texture, the WebGL Texture object will be stored here.\n     * @type {Array<UniformInternalDescription>}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.uniforms_ = [];\n    options.uniforms && Object.keys(options.uniforms).forEach(function(name) {\n      this.uniforms_.push({\n        name: name,\n        value: options.uniforms[name]\n      });\n    }.bind(this));\n\n    /**\n     * An array of PostProcessingPass objects is kept in this variable, built from the steps provided in the\n     * options.

The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles, and the priority is defined by the z-index of the style. Lower z-index\n * means higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike} [style] Layer style. See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the\n * setting will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`,\n * batches will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during interactions.
